Internet Computing Assignment - 4 ReactJS Application

For Assignment - 4, I have implemented my personal blog site "mithiloswal.com" where I have reviewed 3 of the latest smartphones in the market. You can select your choice from the navigation bar on the right.
I have used HTML and CSS for the structure and styling of the pages. I have also used React, Sass, Gulp and Node.js technologies.

Steps to run application:

1.) Open the Node.js command prompt and change directory to the project folder.

2.) Run 'npm start' command.

3.) The application will automatically open in the browser, if not, open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser.
